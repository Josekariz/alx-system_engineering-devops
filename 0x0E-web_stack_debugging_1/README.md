Network Basics
Network basics encompass the fundamental principles and components of computer networking. Key concepts include:

IP Addressing: Identification assigned to each device on a network to facilitate communication.
Subnetting: Dividing a network into smaller sub-networks for efficient resource utilization.
Protocols: Standardized rules governing data transmission and communication between devices.
Routing: Determining the optimal path for data to travel across a network.
Firewalls: Security measures preventing unauthorized access and controlling network traffic.
Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving issues within the web development stack. Key aspects include:

Server Configuration: Ensuring proper configuration of web servers (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to handle incoming requests.
Error Diagnosis: Identifying and troubleshooting errors in web applications or server setups.
Log Analysis: Analyzing server logs to trace issues, understand system behavior, and pinpoint error sources.
Performance Optimization: Enhancing web application performance by addressing bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
Security Debugging: Detecting and fixing security vulnerabilities within the web stack.
